To Generate the final document for my thesis, I have to add a front cover generated by the institute I was working at.

To do this, I use the `pdftk` utility (which can be installed on ubuntu using `sudo apt install pdftk`).
I also want to keep the LaTeX-generated bookmarks, so I have to not disturb the amount of pages and their position. I thus add a blank page at the beginning of my LaTeX document and use the following `pdftk` command:
```bash
pdftk A=frontpage.pdf B=thesis.pdf cat A B2-end output thesis_frontpage.pdf
```
However, this does not copy the metadata (including the bookmarks), so there is an extra step:
```bash
pdftk thesis.pdf dump_data > these_data.info
```
to extract the original metadata, and:
```bash
pdftk thesis_frontpage.pdf update_info these_data.info output these_frontpage_bookmarks.pdf
```

I now have a final file with the correct frontpage and working hyperlinks and bookmarks !
